# Reddit Clawler üêæ

A command-line tool written in Rust that crawls Reddit posts from a user or subreddit.

## Usage

You can see all available commands by running:

```sh
./reddit_clawler --help
```

Download posts from `/u/spez` with spawning `50` tasks emitting to `output/spez`:

```sh
./reddit_clawler user spez --tasks 50 -o output
```

Download posts from `/r/redpandas` from the `top` tab filtered by `hour`:

```sh
./reddit_clawler subreddit redpandas --category top --timeframe hour
```

## Features

Currently supports these providers (these are the most common I found):

- [x] Reddit Images
- [x] Reddit Videos
- [x] Reddit Galleries
- [x] YouTube Videos
- [x] Redgifs Videos
- [x] Local caching

## Planned

- [ ] Imgur Images
- [ ] Providing custom filename scheme
- [ ] Configuration for conversion to other/small formats (avif/webp)
- [ ] Remove duplicated

## Development

You can use the `--skip` flag to skip the download process:

```sh
cargo run -- user spez --skip
```

You can use the `--mock` flag to provide a mock file for the responses of the Reddit client:

```sh
cargo run -- user spez --mock ./tests/mocks/reddit/submitted_response/reddit_video.json
```
